# Suraj S Pillai — Personal Portfolio (Website)

**Live preview (Lovable):** [https://lovable.dev/projects/9d67dfa3-7212-42c6-ac32-74fbe42a79ce](https://lovable.dev/projects/9d67dfa3-7212-42c6-ac32-74fbe42a79ce)

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio website — a modern, responsive, and slightly-stylized single-page site built with **Vite + React + TypeScript**, styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn-ui**. The site showcases my resume, featured projects, and a contact form (Formspree integration). The copy and structure are optimized for recruiters and ATS parsing while still looking polished for human visitors.

## Run locally (development)

Make sure you have Node.js (recommended via nvm) and npm/yarn/pnpm installed.

```bash
# 1. Clone repo
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start dev server
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173 (or as printed in console)
```

## Environment / Formspree (contact form)

The contact form submits to Formspree. Use an environment variable to keep the endpoint configurable.

1. Create `.env.local` in the project root:

```
VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/xanpkrap
```

2. In the code, the fetch uses `import.meta.env.VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT` (Vite env prefix). Example:

```ts
const endpoint = import.meta.env.VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT;
fetch(endpoint, { method: "POST", headers: {...}, body: JSON.stringify({...}) });
```

> Note: After the first incoming message you must confirm the form in Formspree (check the signup email / spam folder) so future submissions are delivered to your inbox.

## Recommended SEO / Social preview (meta)

Add these meta tags to `index.html` (replace placeholders):

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Suraj S Pillai — Flutter Developer" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Flutter Developer building high-performance cross-platform apps. Explore projects, resume, and contact." />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://yourdomain.com/preview.png" />
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta name="description" content="Suraj S Pillai • Flutter Developer — E-commerce, Tourism, Meals apps with Django & Firebase integration. Contact for collaboration." />
```

A clear subject line helps avoid spam in Formspree emails:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="New Message from Suraj S Pillai Portfolio" />
```

## Accessibility & ATS best practices included

* Single-column layout (preferred by ATS)
* Plain-text resume download (`resume.pdf`) included
* Semantic HTML: `<header>`, `<section>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`
* High contrast and keyboard-focus styles
* Structured headings (H1/H2/H3) for scannability

---

## Contributing

If you find typos or want to improve content:

1. Fork → create a branch
2. Make edits (resume copy, project descriptions, or UI/UX tweaks)
3. Submit a PR — I'll review and merge

If you want me to automatically sync resume updates (FlowCV → repo), we can add a small workflow or a script to convert your FlowCV export into `public/resume.pdf` and update it automatically.

If you want, I can:

* Add a **Deploy → GitHub Actions** workflow that builds and publishes on every push to `main`.
* Generate a **social preview image** (`preview.png`) matching your resume style (blue accent, name, and headline).
* Create a **thank-you page** and wire `_redirect` for Formspree submissions.

Which of those should I add next?
